# challenge-two-bubbles
redoing challenge2!


## What's the point of this page?
This is the beginning of my portfolion that I plan to use to apply to jobs in the future. It's in the very early stages, and I plan to make it more cohesive and less rudimentary
in the future. I will display all of my skills (especially the ones that i enjoy most), projects worked on, and anything else that could be useful for a portfolio/future employer.

## How did I build this?
I built this using HTML and CSS. No javascript yet, but i have big ideas for later on.

## Where can I find it?
This website can be found here: https://mmlawton15.github.io/challenge-two-bubbles/

## What does it look like?
You can see a preview of my portfolio in the Issues section of my github repo: https://github.com/mmlawton15/challenge-two-bubbles/issues/1
