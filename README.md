# challenge-two-bubbles
This was challenge 2 of our bootcamp where we were tasked with ubilding our Portfolio with our projects and assignments from the class.

## What's the point of this page?
This is the beginning of my portfolio that I plan to use to apply to jobs in the future. It's in the very early stages, and I plan to make it more cohesive and less rudimentary in the future. I will display all of my skills (especially the ones that i enjoy most), projects worked on, and anything else that could be useful for a portfolio/future employer.

## How did I build this?
I built this using HTML and CSS. No javascript yet, but i have big ideas for later on.

## Where can I find it?
This website can be found here: https://mmlawton15.github.io/challenge-two-bubbles/

## What does it look like?
