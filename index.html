        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hi! I am Mary Margaret, and want to thank you for visiting my page. Welcome to my portfolio, where you will find a bit about me, my work, and my contact information.
        </p>
        <p>
            My favorite hobbies include hanging out with friends and family, travelling, reading the classics (Count of Monte Christo remains to be my all-time favorite), and trying new foods. My professional interests include Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Cyber Security. The more I learn about this field, the more excited I get to find the next opportunity to spread my wings.
        </p>

        <h2>My Work</h2>
        <p>
            Below you will find samples of my works, and links to my GitHub account where you can find all of my bootcamp projects and activities we worked on. Stay tuned for my app, Grocery Lister. Conceptually it's where it needs to be, just gotta find the time to develop it!
        </p>
        <!--figure out how to link my github and put my projects, with titled images of my applications here.-->
        <!--first app needs to be a larger image than the rest of my apps-->
        <!--when an image is clicked it needs to take you to the deployed application-->
