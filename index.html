                <h3>About Me</h3>
                <p>Hi! Thank you for visiting my page. Welcome to my portfolio, 
                    where you will find a bit about me, my work, and my contact information.</p>
                <h3>Mary Margaret, M&M, MML...</h3>
                    <p>
                        The list goes on. I will be impressed if you can come up with a new nickname! In my free time, I like to hangout with friends and family. 
                        The majority of my free time is occupied by those around me. 
                        When I have time for myself, I love reading the classics (The Count of Monte Christo remains my favorite) and thinking that I'm a great cook.
                        My loved ones are always the first to try these concoctions, much to their dismay.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I am always up for an adventure, and have been fortunate enough to spend time in different cities across the states, as well as abroad. 
                        My favorite places to visit are NYC, Florence, IT, and Palm Beach, FL.
                    </p>
            <h3>Professional Interests</h3>
                <p>
                    I studied Graphic Design in college and loved seeing my ideas come to life. Since graduation I've been in the staffing industry,
                    which really opened my eyes to all kinds of different industries. I took AP computer science through high school, and recently decided to revist this field.
                    I have really enjoyed learning during this bootcamp, and can't wait to marry my background in Graphic Design with Full Stack Development. Other technology fields 
                    that interest me are Cyber Security, Artificial Intelligence, Green Tech, and Machine Learning.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am an optimistic and inquisitive student, and can't wait to see what my future holds in technology.

                                The Password Generator is an app that I would use to generate a completely random password. This can be used by anyone that needs a password for any
                                kind of application, and very effectively randomizes the characters selected for your password.

                            The Work Day Scheduler functions similarly to a calendar app, it allows the user to schedule their daily tasks by the hour and reflects the current date
                            and time. The previous time is greyed out, the current time will be red, and the upcoming time will be green. This uses local storage to allow for
                            tasks to persist after the browser has been closed. Users can edit, delete and create tasks on this page

                        <p class="card-text">
                            Our second group project is probably my favorite one we have worked on so far. It was a full stack application that 
                            was based on creating chatacter sheets for Dungeons and Dragons. I know nothing about DnD, so I enjoyed working 
                            with team members that were incredibly passionate and knowledgeable on the topic.

                            The Notetaker app was our challenge we used to show our skills with Express.js. It's an application that allows users to create, edit and delete
                            notes and these notes persist using a JSON database. It was designed to replace a paper notebook!

                            The Budget Tracker was our first exposure to Progressive Web Applications. We handled the backend logic, more specifically the offline capabilities.
                            If a user loses internet access, the app will log their transactions using IndexedDB. Once they regain network access, Indexed DB will load 
                            these transactions into the app!

                            The Weather Dashboard was our introduction to Server-Side APIs. we were tasked with building a weather app, where the user could search for a city and
                            get the daily forecast, as well as the 5 day forecast. The users recent searches were then logged as buttons on the far right for quick access.

                            I created a tutorial for Regular Expressions, which are incredibly powerful tools used for data validation. It allows developers
                            to match user input to match a specific Regex formula comprised of different letters, numbers and symbols. Regex
                            allows for flexibility and efficiency when coding and looking for certain inputs from users.
