            <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                Hi! I am Mary Margaret, and want to thank you for visiting my page. Welcome to my portfolio, where you will find a bit about me, my work, and my contact information.
                </p>
            <h3>Mary Margaret, M&M, MML...</h3>
                <p>
                    The list never ends. I will be impressed if you can come up with a new nickname without googling it! In my free time, I like to hangout with friends and family. 
                    Whether that's trying a new restaurant, exploring a new area of town, or just spending time together. The majority of my free time is occupied by those around me. 
                    When I have time for myself, I love reading the classics (The Count of Monte Christo remains to be my favorite of all time) and thinking that I'm a great cook. 
                    I am always looking for ways to make something healthy taste just as good as its unhealthy counterpart. My loved ones are always the first to try these concoctions, much to their dismay.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am *usually* always up for an adventure, and have been fortunate enough to spend time in different cities across the states, as well as abroad. My favorite places to visit are NYC, Florence, IT, and Sedona, AZ.
                </p>
            <h3>Professional Interests</h3>
                <p>
                    I studied Graphic Design in college and through the internships and jobs I had in that field, learned it wasn't quite where I wanted to be. I have since been in the staffing industry,
                    which has really opened my eyes to all the different opportunities out there. I took AP computer science through high school, and recently decided to revist that field as my latest challenge.
                    Based on the conversations I have had with my friends in this field, I have learned I am most interested in Cyber Security, Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am hoping throughout the duration of this bootcamp that I can learn even more about this field. I am excited about this challenging endeavor and can't wait to see what the future holds.
                </p>

                Below you will find samples of my works, and links to my GitHub account where you can find all of my bootcamp projects and activities we worked on. Stay tuned for my app, Grocery Lister. Conceptually it's where it needs to be, just gotta find the time to develop it!

                    <p>
                        Run Buddy was the first project that I started in the bootcamp. It took 2 weeks inside and outside of class to complete, and is a fitness app 
                        users can sign up for. When they sign up, the get assigned one of the pictured trainers and consult about their desired result. The point of the app
                        is to come to Run Buddy to get a individualized consult and see results.

                        This was our second project of the bootcamp, where we essentially debugged the CSS and HTML files to make the website fully functional.
                        This included making the links click to the correct sections and adding alt descriptions for every image.

                        This project was our first project using and learning Javascript. This gave us a foundation in Javascript basics, including primitive data types, functions, objects and control flow statements.

                    The Password Generator was our third graded Challenge of the bootcamp. It challenged us to use everything we had learned thus far in the bootcamp, including arrays, how to randomize arrays, global and local scope variables, and pseudocoding the logic behind what we wanted to do.
