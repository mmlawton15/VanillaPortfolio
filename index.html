                <h3>About Me</h3>
                <p>Hi! Thank you for visiting my page. Welcome to my portfolio, 
                    where you will find a bit about me, my work, and my contact information.</p>
                <h3>Mary Margaret, M&M, MML...</h3>
                    <p>
                        The list goes on. I will be impressed if you can come up with a new nickname without googling it! In my free time, I like to hangout with friends and family. 
                        Whether that's trying a new restaurant, exploring a new area of town, or just spending time together. The majority of my free time is occupied by those around me. 
                        When I have time for myself, I love reading the classics (The Count of Monte Christo remains to be my favorite of all time) and thinking that I'm a great cook. 
                        I am always looking for ways to make something healthy taste just as good as its unhealthy counterpart. My loved ones are always the first to try these concoctions, much to their dismay.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I am *usually* always up for an adventure, and have been fortunate enough to spend time in different cities across the states, as well as abroad. 
                        My favorite places to visit are NYC, Florence, IT, and Palm Beach, FL.
                    </p>
            <h3>Professional Interests</h3>
                <p>
                    I studied Graphic Design in college and through the jobs I had in that field, learned it wasn't quite where I wanted to be. I have since been in the staffing industry,
                    which has really opened my eyes to all the different opportunities for work. I took AP computer science through high school, and recently decided to revist the computer science industry.
                    Based on the conversations I have had with mentors and friends in this field, I have learned I am most interested in Full Stack Development. I am also intrigued by
                    Cyber Security, Artificial Intelligence, Green Tech, and Machine Learning.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am an optimistic and inquisitive student, and am excited to marry my background in Graphic Design with Full Stack Development. I have enjoyed my time in this bootcamp,
                    and can't wait to see what my future holds in technology.

                            The team profile generator is an app I pictured someone in HR using to build out a team for a manager and quickly access everyone's information.
                            This was our first exposure to Object Oriented Programming, and was a challenging one! In order for this application to be used, you will need
                            to run Node.js from your terminal window, as this is a primarily backend app.

                            Gas Guru was our first group project where we focused on building a interactive front end project. Our Idea was an app that lets you type in a zipcode,
                            and the lowest gas prices would be presented to you (via an api). Based on that zipcode, you also go an alert if there was inclement weather so you'd know to
                            drive safely.

                        <p class="card-text">
                            The Weather Dashboard was our introduction to Server-Side APIs. we were tasked with building a weather app, where the user could search for a city and
                            get the daily forecast, as well as the 5 day forecast. The users recent searches were then logged as buttons on the far right for quick access.

                            The Work Day Scheduler functions similarly to a calendar app, it allows the user to schedule their daily tasks by the hour and reflects the current date
                            and time. The previous time is greyed out, the current time will be red, and the upcoming time will be green. This uses local storage to allow for
                            tasks to persist after the browser has been closed. Users can edit, delete and create tasks on this page

                                The coding quiz is an app that quizzes players on a pre-identified set of questions. It runs on a timer that decreases with every

                                Robot Gladiator was our introduction to Javascript, and is a game that prompts the user to fight 3 different robot enemies. The users and 
                                robots were given health stats, the robots give different attack stats, and the game logic allowed the user to battle until they died 
                                or defeated all the robots. 
                                This gave us a foundation in Javascript basics, including primitive data types, functions, objects and control flow statements.
