                <h3>About Me</h3>
                <p>Hi! Thank you for visiting my page. Welcome to my portfolio, 
                    where you will find a bit about me, my work, and my contact information.</p>
                <h3>Mary Margaret, M&M, MML...</h3>
                    <p>
                        The list goes on. I will be impressed if you can come up with a new nickname without googling it! In my free time, I like to hangout with friends and family. 
                        Whether that's trying a new restaurant, exploring a new area of town, or just spending time together. The majority of my free time is occupied by those around me. 
                        When I have time for myself, I love reading the classics (The Count of Monte Christo remains to be my favorite of all time) and thinking that I'm a great cook. 
                        I am always looking for ways to make something healthy taste just as good as its unhealthy counterpart. My loved ones are always the first to try these concoctions, much to their dismay.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I am *usually* always up for an adventure, and have been fortunate enough to spend time in different cities across the states, as well as abroad. My favorite places to visit are NYC, Florence, IT, and Sedona, AZ.
                    </p>
            <h3>Professional Interests</h3>
                <p>
                    I studied Graphic Design in college and through the jobs I had in that field, learned it wasn't quite where I wanted to be. I have since been in the staffing industry,
                    which has really opened my eyes to all the different opportunities for work. I took AP computer science through high school, and recently decided to revist that field as my latest challenge.
                    Based on the conversations I have had with mentors and friends in this field, I have learned I am most interested in Full Stack Development. I am also intrigued by
                    Cyber Security, Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am an optimistic and inquisitive student, and am excited to marry my background in Graphic Design with Full Stack Development. I have enjoyed my time in this bootcamp,
                    and can't wait to see what the future holds in technology.

                                    This was our first project of the bootcamp, where we essentially debugged the CSS and HTML files to make the website fully functional.
                                    This included making the links click to the correct sections and adding alt descriptions for every image.

                                    Robot Gladiator was our introduction to Javascript, and is a game that prompts the user to fight 3 different robot enemies. The users and 
                                    robots were given health stats, the robots give different attack stats, and the game logic allowed the user to battle until they died 
                                    or defeated all the robots. 
                                    This gave us a foundation in Javascript basics, including primitive data types, functions, objects and control flow statements.

                                The coding quiz is an app that quizzes players on a pre-identified set of questions. It runs on a timer that decreases with every
                                incorrect answer, and with every correct answer you will get points. At the end, you are able to add your initials ad log your high score.

                            The Work Day Scheduler functions similarly to a calendar app, it allows the user to schedule their daily tasks by the hour and reflects the current date
                            and time. The previous time is greyed out, the current time will be red, and the upcoming time will be green. This uses local storage to allow for
                            tasks to persist after the browser has been closed. Users can edit, delete and create tasks on this page

                            The Weather Dashboard was our introduction to Server-Side APIs. we were tasked with building a weather app, where the user could search for a city and

                            using callback functions, use the DOM to read and create content to add/edit on the page, save data using localStorage and track technical
