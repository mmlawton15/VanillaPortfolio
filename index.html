        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hi! I am Mary Margaret, and want to thank you for visiting my page. Welcome to my portfolio, where you will find a bit about me, my work, and where to find me.
        </p>
        <p>
            My favorite hobbies include hanging out with friends and family, travelling, reading the classics (Count of Monte Christo remains to be my all-time favorite), and trying new foods. My professional interests include Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Cyber Security. The more I learn about this field, the more excited I get to find the next opportunity to spread my wings.
