                <h3>About Me</h3>
                <p>Hi! I am Mary Margaret, and want to thank you for visiting my page. Welcome to my portfolio, 
                    where you will find a bit about me, my work, and my contact information.</p>
                <h3>Mary Margaret, M&M, MML...</h3>
                    <p>
                        The list goes on. I will be impressed if you can come up with a new nickname without googling it! In my free time, I like to hangout with friends and family. 
                        Whether that's trying a new restaurant, exploring a new area of town, or just spending time together. The majority of my free time is occupied by those around me. 
                        When I have time for myself, I love reading the classics (The Count of Monte Christo remains to be my favorite of all time) and thinking that I'm a great cook. 
                        I am always looking for ways to make something healthy taste just as good as its unhealthy counterpart. My loved ones are always the first to try these concoctions, much to their dismay.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I am *usually* always up for an adventure, and have been fortunate enough to spend time in different cities across the states, as well as abroad. My favorite places to visit are NYC, Florence, IT, and Sedona, AZ.
                    </p>
            <h3>Professional Interests</h3>
                <p>
                    I studied Graphic Design in college and through the jobs I had in that field, learned it wasn't quite where I wanted to be. I have since been in the staffing industry,
                    which has really opened my eyes to all the different opportunities for work. I took AP computer science through high school, and recently decided to revist that field as my latest challenge.
                    Based on the conversations I have had with mentors and friends in this field, I have learned I am most interested in Full Stack Development. I am also intrigued by
                    Cyber Security, Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am an optimistic and inquisitive student, and am excited to marry my background in Graphic Design with Full Stack Development. I have enjoyed my time in this bootcamp,
                    and can't wait to see what the future holds in technology.

                                    This was our second project of the bootcamp, where we essentially debugged the CSS and HTML files to make the website fully functional.
                                    This included making the links click to the correct sections and adding alt descriptions for every image.

                                    The Password Generator was our third graded Challenge of the bootcamp. It challenged us to use everything we had learned thus far in the bootcamp, including arrays, how to randomize arrays, global and local scope variables, and pseudocoding the logic behind what we wanted to do.
